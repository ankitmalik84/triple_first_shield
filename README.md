Welcome to Triple First Sig Regt, a Flutter application designed with security in mind, particularly for high-confidential areas like army cantonments.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this app is to enhance security measures by scanning devices for installed applications that are banned within army cantonment areas. Upon installation, Triple Shield conducts a thorough scan of the device and provides a comprehensive list of installed apps that are restricted within army cantonment premises. Moreover, it offers the convenience of directly uninstalling these prohibited apps from within the Triple Shield interface.
